# VisIntSem2022

This is the R code for the Visual Intelligence seminar "The 99% accuracy club" held 3rd of February 2022 on zoom. 

To run the code, a file with the results from the challenge is needed. 
Andrew Mashchak did a web scrape from https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/leaderboard.  

The AUCs and CIs differ a bit from the numbers presented in the seminar, because I did make two minor mistakes when first preparing this talk. 
But the numbers do not differ that much.
